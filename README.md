# 4D-Lab Logos

The goal of this repository is to centralize visual assets so they can be reused across different repositories, documentations, READMEs, websites, or related materials, without having to duplicate image files in each project.

These assets are intended for use only within authorized projects and contexts. Redistribution, modification, or use outside of their intended scope is not permitted without prior written permission from the repository owner.
